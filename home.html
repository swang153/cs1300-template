          <h6><i>Stepping into the shoes of toaster users</i></h6>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>For my first CS 1300 project, I observed real users interacting with an interface
          of my choice. I decided on the toaster that my family of four uses because I'm
          currently studying remotely from home. <br> <br>
          I conducted interviews with my family members, observed their experiences, 
          created personas based on my research, and illustrated a storyboard from one of my two personas.
          </p>
          <h2>The Interface</h2>
          <p>This is a 2-slot toaster manufactured by Sunbeam that was toasts bread/bagels to make them crispy and tasty. It has a lever you push down to start the toasting.
            There is a knob that controls the heating setting and three buttons for added functionality: bagel, cancel, and warm/reheat.

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>I observed the following from my family members on a Saturday morning:</p>
          <dl class="row">
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Judy, a 55-year-old</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Toasted one slice of gluten-free bread on the 3 heating setting. To retrieve her toast, she pushed up the lever and used her hands to extract the slice of bread from the toaster.</dd>
          
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Derong, a 59-year-old</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Toasted a large egg everything bagel on the 5 heating setting. He had trouble getting the thick slices of the bagel out from the slot and ended up using a pair of chop to grab the bagel.
            
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Susan, a third-year medical student</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Toasted two slices of wheat bread on the 3 heating setting. When they finished toasting, the toast popped up out of the toaster onto the kitchen counter.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <ol class="list">
            <li><b><i><u>What do you like about using the toaster?</u></i></b></li>
            <p><b>Judy</b> and <b>Susan</b> both said they liked how the toaster was easy to use.</p> 
            <p><b>Derong</b> and <b>Judy</b> said they liked how the toaster could give bread or bagels a crispy and more flavorful taste.</p>
            <p><b>Susan</b> added that the appliance is very reliable and hasn't declined in function. She also likes how the individual chambers are very large.</p>
            
            <li><b><i><u>What are some difficulties you have when using the toaster?</u></i></b></li>
            <p><b>Susan</b> said it’s difficult to get the toast out at the end in a way that doesn’t risk burning her fingers. <b>Derong</b> mentioned how it was inconvenient to have to use chopsticks to retrieve his bagel.</p>
            <p><b>Judy</b> listed many difficulties she has with using the toaster. Because the heat setting is easy to adjust and it’s hard to tell the difference between the numbers, she could end up with burnt toast if someone accidentally changed the settings. She also said she was irritated by how the toaster doesn’t indicate how long it will take to finish the job and how the crumb collection pan is at the back and hard to remove.</p>
            
            <li><b><i><u>What do you dislike most about the toaster? Why?</u></i></b></li>
            <p><b>Derong</b> said he disliked how the toaster took too long to toast bread and bagels because he is in a rush most mornings.</p>
            <p><b>Judy</b> most disliked how unclear the setting feature is because she doesn’t know what each number means: Is it the time or crispy level?</p>
            <p><b>Susan</b> shared that she disliked how aggressively the toast pops up at the end. She said that sometimes, like today, it’s so forceful that her toast falls on the counter and she has to toast a new piece.</p>
            
            <li><b><i><u>If you could make any changes to the design of the toaster, what would they be?</u></i></b></li>
            <p>Both <b>Derong</b> and <b>Susan</b> would make changes to the heat source. <b>Derong</b> said he would make the heat source more powerful so the toaster could work faster. <b>Susan</b> said she would add a heat source between the two slots so that whether she’s toasting one or two things, everything gets equally cooked.</p>
            <p><b>Judy</b>, a product manager, provided many possible changes that she would make to the toaster. First, she would redesign the setting knob and correlate it with crispy level, temperature and time. She would add a function to show remaining time and add intelligence to adjust toasting time and temperature based on bread thickness, whole wheat, white, multigrain, etc. To incorporate all her changes, she said that it would be better to upgrade the toaster to have a digital interface. Lastly, she would reconfigure the crum pan so that users can remove it from the front of the toaster rather than the back.</p>
          </ol>
          <h2>Personas</h2>
          <h5><i>Meet Irene.</i></h5>
          <p>Irene is a mother of four young children who wakes up early each morning to prepare breakfast for her kids.</p>
          <p>Because each of her children have different tastes, Irene must toasted three different types of bread: an english muffin, two bagels, and regular sliced wheat bread. It’s difficult for her to remember what each heating setting each bread needs and she must spend extra time toasting in several rounds because the toaster only has two slots. Irene is also in charge of cleaning the appliance and finds it inconvenient that the crumb collector is at the back and is ineffective at collecting most of the crumbs that fall.</p>
          <p>Irene represents the parents who are responsible for making meals for their families and that thus need appliances that can cook large quantities of different types of food.</p>

          <br>
          <h5><i>Meet Henry.</i></h5>
          <p>Henry is a college student who shares an apartment with three roommates who also use the toaster. Juggling an intense course load with two part-time jobs, Henry uses the toaster often because it provides a quick and tasty meal in the mornings.</p>
          <p>Since Henry uses the toaster with his roommates, he sometimes forgets to change the heat setting from the one his roommate uses and ends up with toast that is burnt or too lightly toasted. Henry is also annoyed when the toaster jolts up aggressively after it’s finished toasting and his slices of bread pop out of the toaster and onto the countertop. Scared of germs, Henry then throws away the piece of bread and has to toast another batch, wasting a lot of precious time in the morning. When he toasts wider items like a bagel, he struggles with taking it out without burning himself.</p>
          <p>Henry represents busy millennials or Generation Z people who often lived in shared spaces and expect immediacy and efficiency in the technology they interact with.</p>
